        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>I was born on the 21st of August, 2003. The day of my birth wasn't very interesting, but the year had quite a few major events. You can read a little about them down below.</p>

        <h3>Last Signal from Pioneer 10</h3>
        <p>On January 23rd, the last signals were received from NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft. Pioneer 10 was a space probe launched in 1972 and was humanity's first mission to Jupiter. After completing its original mission, it became the first man-made object to achieve escape velocity out of the solar system.</p>

        <h3>The Columbia Disaster</h3>
        <p>On the 1st of February, the NASA space shuttle Columbia broke up while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere killing all seven members of the crew. Investigations found that a section of the shuttle's thermal protection system, on the left wing, had been damaged by debris from the external fuel tank during take-off. This allowed heat produced by re-entry to enter, and destroy, the shuttle's wing structure.</p>

        <h3>Last Commercial Concorde Flight</h3>
        <p>On the 24th of October, the final commercial flight of Concorde touched down at London Heathrow airport bringing the age of supersonic air travel to an end. While a sad time for aviation enthusiasts, the aircraft was nearly fourty years old and struggled to keep up with the luxury offered by larger subsonic aircraft. In addition, Airbus made the decision to stop supplying spare parts for the aircraft which was really the final nail in the coffin.</p>

                    <p>In June 2018, I completed four days of work experience at ACCA Global's Glasgow headquarters.
                        During my time there, I
                        was shown how the IT department runs, and what they were working on at the time. While I had
                        been taught
                        about many of the basic ideas in school, mainly the AGILE method of development, it was
                        interesting to see
                        parts of it in practice.

                        restaurant serving both food and drink. I'm still working at the Garfield as of

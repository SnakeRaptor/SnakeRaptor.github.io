        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>This page is all about me. I'm sure it will make for some pretty boring reading...</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>I was born on the 21st of August, 2003. While the day of my birth wasn't very interesting, 2003 was an interesting year. Here's a few of the major events:
            <ul>
                <li>1st of February: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia Disaster</a></li>
                <li>19th of March: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq">Invasion of Iraq</a></li>
                <li>16th of April: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Accession_2003#:~:text=The%20Treaty%20of%20Accession%202003,enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union).">Treaty of Accession</a></li>
                <li>10th of June: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)">NASA's Spirit Rover</a></li>
            </ul>
        OK, so it started a bit of a downer of a year, but things picked up towards the end I suppose!

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Despite being a computer nerd, I do actually have a few hobbies! Here's a little about them.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Perhaps my biggest hobby, I can easily spend hours playing PC games. Some of my favourites are:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Iron_IV">Hearts of Iron IV</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Fever_2">Transport Fever 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Thieves">Sea of Thieves</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a></li>
            </ul>
            That's barely a scratch on the surface, and if you can't tell I like all kinds of games.

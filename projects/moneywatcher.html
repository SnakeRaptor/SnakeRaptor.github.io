        <h2>What is Money Watcher?</h2>
        <p>Money Watcher is an application I'm currently working on to keep a track of my personal finances. It's
            programmed in Java for cross-platform compatbility, and I've made it my New Year's resolution for 2023 to
            actually finish it.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>My parents have been using Microsoft Money for years, but Microsoft stopped updating and supporting the
            software in 2011. My aim is to create an application that can do what MS Money could, and maybe more. I'm
            still deciding whether to keep it open source, or whether I should make it a commerical product. We'll
            see...</p>

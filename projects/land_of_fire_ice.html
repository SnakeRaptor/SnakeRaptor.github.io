        <h2>What is "Land of Fire and Ice"?</h2>
        <p>"Land of Fire and Ice" is a mod I'm creating for the Paradox Interactive game Hearts of Iron IV. The aim is
            to give Iceland a part to play in the game. It isn't anywhere near completion, but I'll keep this page
            updated as time goes on.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why am I creating this mod?</h2>
        <p>I recently took a trip to Iceland, and the country is absolutely incredible. From mountains to mud pools,
            glaciers to geisers, the country really has a bit of everything. I decided it deserved a place as a strong
            nation in HoI4, even if it was a little historically innacurate...</p>

        <h3>What is Krypton?</h3>
        <p>Krypton is a library of methods that can be used for basic file handling, as well as for encrypting and
            decrypting strings.</p>


            <br />

        <h3>What encryption does Krypton offer?</h3>
        <p>Krypton offers basic encryption and decryption using the following formats available through C#'s Encoding
            class:
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII</li>
            <li>Latin1</li>
            <li>Unicode</li>
            <li>UTF-8</li>
            <li>UTF-32</li>
        </ul>
        Please note that these forms of encryption are not extremely secure and should only be used to stop a person
        from directly accessing a file's data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="setup">
        <h2>Setup</h2>

        <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
        <p>To use Krypton, you must first add the DLL file as a reference. If you are not using Visual Studio, check
            your IDE's documentation
            to see how to add project references. In all IDEs, the final step will be the same. If you are using Visual
            Studio, you can add a reference by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <mark>Project > Add Project Reference > Browse</mark> then locate and select the
                <mark>Vega.Krypton.dll</mark> file on your computer.
            </li>
            <li>Click OK and wait for Visual Studio to add the reference.</li>
            <li>Finally, import the library to a file. If you are using C#, you can do this with the following code:
                <mark>using Vega.Krypton;</mark>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br />

        <h3>The KryptonType Enum</h3>
        <p>Before you can Krypton's encryption features, you will need to create an instance of the
            <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum. You will pass this in whenever you are creating an instance of the
            <mark>Krypton</mark> class which is covered later. To create, and configure, the <mark>KryptonType</mark>
            enum, use the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the setup process outline above. Otherwise you won't have access to the
                <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum!</li>
            <li>Create a new instance of the <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum in the same way you would with any other. In
                C#, this can be done with the following line of code: <mark>KryptonType kt;</mark></li>
            <li>Choose the type of encryption you wish to use. This can be done by assigning a value to the newly
                created enum instance. The values that can be assigned are: <mark>A</mark>, <mark>L</mark>, <mark>U</mark>, <mark>U8</mark> and <mark>U32</mark>. Each corresponds to an
                encryption type: ASCII, Latin1, Unicode, UTF-8 and UTF-32 respectively. In C#, the value can be assigned
                with the following code: <mark>kt = KryptonType.A;</mark></li>
        </ol>

        <br />
        
        <h3>The Krypton Class</h3>
        <p>All of Krypton's functionality is held within its namesake class: <mark>Krypton</mark>. You can create an instance of the <mark>Krypton</mark> class in the same way you would any other class. However, a <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum must be passed into the object when it is created. In C#, this can be done using the following code: <mark>Krypton krypt = new Krypton(kt);</mark></p>

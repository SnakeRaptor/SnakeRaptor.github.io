        <h2>Basic Information</h2>

        <h3>What is Krypton?</h3>
        <p>Krypton is a library of methods that can be used for basic file handling, as well as for encoding and
            decoding strings.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>What encoding does Krypton offer?</h3>
        <p>Krypton offers basic encoding and decoding using the following formats available through C#'s Encoding
            class:
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII</li>
            <li>Latin1</li>
            <li>Unicode</li>
            <li>UTF-8</li>
            <li>UTF-32</li>
        </ul>
        Please note that these are not true forms of encryption and can be easily decrypted.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section" id="setup">
        <h2>Setup</h2>

        <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
        <p>To use Krypton, you must first add the DLL file as a reference. If you are not using Visual Studio, check
            your IDE's documentation
            to see how to add project references. In all IDEs, the final step will be the same. If you are using Visual
            Studio, you can add a reference by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <mark>Project > Add Project Reference > Browse</mark> then locate and select the
                <mark>Vega.Krypton.dll</mark> file on your computer.
            </li>
            <li>Click OK and wait for Visual Studio to add the reference.</li>
            <li>Finally, import the library to a file or class. If you are using C#, you can do this with the following
                code:
                <mark>using Vega.Krypton;</mark>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br />

        <h3>The KryptonType Enum</h3>
        <p>Before you can use Krypton's encoding features, you will need to create an instance of the
            <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum. You will pass this in whenever you are creating an instance of the
            <mark>Krypton</mark> class which is covered later. To create, and configure, the <mark>KryptonType</mark>
            enum, use the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the setup process outline above. Otherwise you won't have access to the
                <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum.
            </li>
            <li>Create a new instance of the <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum in the same way you would with any other. In
                C#, this can be done with the following line of code: <mark>KryptonType kt;</mark></li>
            <li>Choose the type of encoding you wish to use. This can be done by assigning a value to the newly
                created enum instance. The values that can be assigned are: <mark>A</mark>, <mark>L</mark>,
                <mark>U</mark>, <mark>U8</mark> and <mark>U32</mark>. Each corresponds to an
                encryption type: ASCII, Latin1, Unicode, UTF-8 and UTF-32 respectively. In C#, the value can be assigned
                with the following code: <mark>kt = KryptonType.A;</mark>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br />

        <h3>The Krypton Class</h3>
        <p>All of Krypton's encoding functionality is held within its namesake class: <mark>Krypton</mark>. You can
            create an instance of the <mark>Krypton</mark> class in the same way you would any other class. However, a
            <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum must be passed into the object when it is created. In C#, this can be done
            using the following code: <mark>Krypton krypt = new Krypton(kt);</mark>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="filehandling">
        <h2>Standard File Handling</h2>
        <p>Whilst the primary function of Krypton is its encoding services, the library also contains operations for
            basic reading and writing to files.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The UFile Class</h3>
        <p>Standard file handling functions can be found inside the <mark>UFile</mark> class. You can access these by
            creating an instance of the class. In C#, this is done with the following code: <mark>UFile uf = new
                UFile()</mark></p>

        <br />

        <h3>Writing to Files</h3>
        <p>The <mark>UFile</mark> class comes with two methods for writing to files:
            <br>The <mark>AppendToFile</mark> method will add text onto the end of an existing file, leaving the rest of
            the file intact.<br>The <mark>OverwriteToFile</mark> method will erase all text in a file and replace it
            with with the text passed into it.<br>Both methods require two arguments in the following order:
        <ol>
            <li>The directory of the file you wish to write to.</li>
            <li>The text you wish to write to the file.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Reading from Files</h3>
        <p>In addition to writing to files, the <mark>UFile</mark> class comes with two methods for reading from files:
            <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> and <mark>ListFromFile</mark>.
            <br>The <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> method will return a string containing all of the text in the file within
            the given directory.
            <br>The <mark>ListFromFile</mark> method will return a List of string, where each item is a new line. This
            is especially useful when reading from a CSV, or other basic data storage file.
            <br>Both methods only reuire one argument: the directory of the file to be read from. Both methods will
            return <mark>null</mark> if an error occurs, so it is good practice to check the output from the method is
            not <mark>null</mark>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="eandd">
        <h2>Encoding and Decoding</h2>
        <p>The primary function of Krypton is to provide basic encoding to strings. Please note that this is not
            encryption, and can be decrypted easily. Its purpose is to make strings unreadable.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The Krypton Class</h3>
        <p>As mentioned <a href="#setup">before</a>, all of Krypton's encoding and decoding functions are located in
            the <mark>Krypton</mark> class. Ensure you have set up an instance of the class before continuing.</p>

        <h3>The Encode Method</h3>
        <p>This method is used to encode a string which is passed to it. To use it in C#, you can use the code:
            <mark>krypt.Encode(myString);</mark>
            <br>From here, the string is taken and converted into the format you chose when creating the
            <mark>Krypton</mark> object. The method then returns the encoded string.
        </p>

        <h3>The Decode Method</h3>
        <p>This method is used to decode a string which is passed to it. To use it in C#, you can use the code:
            <mark>krypt.Decode(myEncryptedString);</mark>
            <br>From here, the string is taken and converted from the format specified when creating the
            <mark>Krpyton</mark> object, into a string. This string is then returned.
            <br>Note that you need to know the type of encoding used for this method to work correctly.
        </p>

        <h3>The SwitchType Method</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used if you wish to change the type of encoding being used by the <mark>Krypton</mark>
            object. To use it, create a new <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum and call the method, passing the enum as an
            argument.
            <br>In C#, this can be done like this: <mark>krypt.SwitchType(kt);</mark>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="encfilehandling">
        <h2>File Handling with Encoding</h2>
        <p>File handling with encoding works similarly to standard file handling and will likely be the most useful
            feature.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The KFile Class</h3>
        <p>File handling functions with encoding can be found inside the <mark>KFile</mark> class. You can access
            these by
            creating an instance of the class. In C#, this is done with the following code: <mark>KFile kf = new
                KFile()</mark></p>

        <br />

        <h3>Writing to Files</h3>
        <p>Similarly to the <mark>UFile</mark> class, the <mark>KFile</mark> class contains two methods for writing to
            files:
            <br>The <mark>AppendToFile</mark> method will encode text, using the chosen encoder, then add it to the
            end of a file leaving the previous contents intact.
            <br>The <mark>OverwriteToFile</mark> method will erase all text in a file and replace it with the text
            passed to the method, encoded using the chosen encoder.
            <br>Both methods require three arguments in the following order:
        <ul>
            <li>The directory of the file you wish to write to.</li>
            <li>The text you wish to write to the file (not encoded).</li>
            <li>A <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum configured to the desired encoding type.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>Reading from Files</h3>
        <p>For reading from an encoded file to work, you must know what type of encoding was used originally. The
            <mark>KFile</mark> class contains two methods for reading encoded files.
            <br>The <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> method will read in text from the specified file, decode it using the
            chosen encoding method, then return a string of the decoded text.
            <br>The <mark>ListFromFile</mark> method will read in text one line at a time into a List of strings,
            decoding each line, then return the List of lines.
            <br>Both methods require two arguments in the following order:
        <ul>
            <li>The directory of the file to be read and decoded.</li>
            <li>A <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum configured to the desired encoding method.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>Basic Information</h2>

        <h3>What is Krypton?</h3>
        <p>Krypton is a library of methods that can be used for basic file handling, as well as for encrypting and
            decrypting strings.</p>


        <br />

        <h3>What encryption does Krypton offer?</h3>
        <p>Krypton offers basic encryption and decryption using the following formats available through C#'s Encoding
            class:
        <ul>
            <li>ASCII</li>
            <li>Latin1</li>
            <li>Unicode</li>
            <li>UTF-8</li>
            <li>UTF-32</li>
        </ul>
        Please note that these forms of encryption are not extremely secure and should only be used to stop a person
        from directly accessing a file's data.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="setup">
        <h2>Setup</h2>

        <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
        <p>To use Krypton, you must first add the DLL file as a reference. If you are not using Visual Studio, check
            your IDE's documentation
            to see how to add project references. In all IDEs, the final step will be the same. If you are using Visual
            Studio, you can add a reference by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <mark>Project > Add Project Reference > Browse</mark> then locate and select the
                <mark>Vega.Krypton.dll</mark> file on your computer.
            </li>
            <li>Click OK and wait for Visual Studio to add the reference.</li>
            <li>Finally, import the library to a file. If you are using C#, you can do this with the following code:
                <mark>using Vega.Krypton;</mark>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br />

        <h3>The KryptonType Enum</h3>
        <p>Before you can Krypton's encryption features, you will need to create an instance of the
            <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum. You will pass this in whenever you are creating an instance of the
            <mark>Krypton</mark> class which is covered later. To create, and configure, the <mark>KryptonType</mark>
            enum, use the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete the setup process outline above. Otherwise you won't have access to the
                <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum!
            </li>
            <li>Create a new instance of the <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum in the same way you would with any other. In
                C#, this can be done with the following line of code: <mark>KryptonType kt;</mark></li>
            <li>Choose the type of encryption you wish to use. This can be done by assigning a value to the newly
                created enum instance. The values that can be assigned are: <mark>A</mark>, <mark>L</mark>,
                <mark>U</mark>, <mark>U8</mark> and <mark>U32</mark>. Each corresponds to an
                encryption type: ASCII, Latin1, Unicode, UTF-8 and UTF-32 respectively. In C#, the value can be assigned
                with the following code: <mark>kt = KryptonType.A;</mark>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br />

        <h3>The Krypton Class</h3>
        <p>All of Krypton's encryption functionality is held within its namesake class: <mark>Krypton</mark>. You can
            create an instance of the <mark>Krypton</mark> class in the same way you would any other class. However, a
            <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum must be passed into the object when it is created. In C#, this can be done
            using the following code: <mark>Krypton krypt = new Krypton(kt);</mark>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="filehandling">
        <h2>Standard File Handling</h2>
        <p>Whilst the primary function of Krypton is its encryption services, the library also contains operations for
            basic reading and writing to files.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The UFile Class</h3>
        <p>Standard file handling functions can be found inside the <mark>UFile</mark> class. You can access these by
            creating an instance of the class. In C#, this is done with the following code: <mark>UFile uf = new
                UFile()</mark></p>

        <br />

        <h3>Writing to Files</h3>
        <p>The <mark>UFile</mark> class comes with two methods for writing to files: <mark>AppendToFile</mark> and
            <mark>OverwriteToFile</mark>.
            <br>The <mark>AppendToFile</mark> method will add text onto the end of an existing file, leaving the rest of
            the file intact.<br>The <mark>OverwriteToFile</mark> method will erase all text in a file and replace it
            with with the text passed into it.<br>Both methods require two arguments in the following order:
        <ol>
            <li>The directory of the file you wish to write to.</li>
            <li>The text you wish to write to the file.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3>Reading from Files</h3>
        <p>In addition to writing to files, the <mark>UFile</mark> class comes with two methods for reading from files:
            <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> and <mark>ListFromFile</mark>.
            <br>The <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> method will return a string containing all of the text in the file within
            the given directory.
            <br>The <mark>ListFromFile</mark> method will return a List of string, where each item is a new line. This
            is especially useful when reading from a CSV, or other basic data storage file.
            <br>Both methods only reuire one argument: the directory of the file to be read from. Both methods will
            return <mark>null</mark> if an error occurs, so it is good practice to check the output from the method is
            not <mark>null</mark>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="eandd">
        <h2>Encryption and Decryption</h2>
        <p>The primary function of Krypton is to provide basic encryption to strings. Please note that these methods of
            encryption are not completely secure, and should only be used to make text not directly readable.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The Krypton Class</h3>
        <p>As mentioned <a href="#setup">before</a>, all of Krypton's encryption and decryption functions are located in
            the <mark>Krypton</mark> class. Ensure you have set up an instance of the class before continuing.</p>

        <h3>The Encode Method</h3>
        <p>This method is used to encrypt a string which is passed to it. To use it in C#, you can use the code:
            <mark>krypt.Encode(myString);</mark>
            <br>From here, the string is taken and converted into the format you chose when creating the
            <mark>Krypton</mark> object. The method then returns the encrypted string.
        </p>

        <h3>The Decode Method</h3>
        <p>This method is used to decrypt a string which is passed to it. To use it in C#, you can use the code:
            <mark>krypt.Decode(myEncryptedString);</mark>
            <br>From here, the string is taken and converted from the format specified when creating the
            <mark>Krpyton</mark> object, into a string. This string is then returned.
            <br>Note that you need to know the type of encryption used for this method to work correctly.
        </p>

        <h3>The SwitchType Method</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used if you wish to change the type of encryption being used by the <mark>Krypton</mark>
            object. To use it, create a new <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum and call the method, passing the enum as an
            argument.
            <br>In C#, this can be done like this: <mark>krypt.SwitchType(kt);</mark>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="encfilehandling">
        <h2>File Handling with Encryption</h2>
        <p>File handling with encryption works similarly to standard file handling and will likely be the most useful
            feature.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>The KFile Class</h3>
        <p>File handling functions with encryption can be found inside the <mark>KFile</mark> class. You can access
            these by
            creating an instance of the class. In C#, this is done with the following code: <mark>KFile kf = new
                KFile()</mark></p>

        <br />

        <h3>Writing to Files</h3>
        <p>Similarly to the <mark>UFile</mark> class, the <mark>KFile</mark> class contains two methods for writing to
            files:
            <br>The <mark>AppendToFile</mark> method will encrypyt text, using the chosen encoder, then add it to the
            end of a file leaving the previous contents intact.
            <br>The <mark>OverwriteToFile</mark> method will erase all text in a file and replace it with the text
            passed to the method, encrypted using the chosen encoder.
            <br>Both methods require three arguments in the following order:
        <ul>
            <li>The directory of the file you wish to write to.</li>
            <li>The text you wish to write to the file (not encrypted).</li>
            <li>A <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum configured to the desired encryption type.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>Reading from Files</h3>
        <p>For reading from an encrypted file to work, you must know what type of encryption was used originally. The <mark>KFile</mark> class contains two methods for reading encrypted files.
        <br>The <mark>ReadFromFile</mark> method will read in text from the specified file, decrypt it using the chosen encryption method, then return a string of the decrypted text.
        <br>The <mark>ListFromFile</mark> method will read in text one line at a time into a List of strings, decrypting each line, then return the List of lines.
        <br>Both methods require two arguments in the following order:
            <ul>
                <li>The directory of the file to be read and decrypted.</li>
                <li>A <mark>KryptonType</mark> enum confgirued to the desired encryption method.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

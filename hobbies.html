        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Despite being a computer nerd, I do actually have a few hobbies! Here's a little about them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Perhaps my biggest hobby, I can easily spend hours playing PC games. Some of my favourites are:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Iron_IV">Hearts of Iron IV</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Fever_2">Transport Fever 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Thieves">Sea of Thieves</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020_video_game)">Microsoft Flight
                    Simulator</a></li>
        </ul>
        That's barely a scratch on the surface, and if you can't tell I like all kinds of games.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>One of my other favourite past-times is programming. Just like with gaming, I can spend hours at a time doing
            it. There's always been something about being able to sit down, imagine something, then create it that I
            just can't get enough of. My favourite programming language would have to be C-Sharp, but it's not the only
            one I know. Here's the full list of every language I've played with over the years:
        <ul>
            <li>C-Sharp</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Scratch (if you call it a language, of course!)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

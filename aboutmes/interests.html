        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>This page is all about the things I enjoy learning about in my spare time, or even in university.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Computing</h2>
        <p>Naturally, one of my biggest interests is computing. The field is changing everyday, from new programming
            languages, updates to old ones, and emerging technologies. I have an especially keen eye on quantum
            computing.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Fuelled on by my favourite band, Sabaton, I have a strong interest in histroy. Seeing how the world ended up
            the way it is, and how different historical events all fit together, is just something that fascinates me.

        <h2>
            It's a bit of a broad label, but I really enjoy reading up on the latest discoveries made in the Final
            Frontier. It's incredible some of the things we've found out there. To think that someday we might be
            visiting all of those things is amazing too.
        </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <p>
            Quite heavily tied in to my interest in space, I find physics an interesting field. I'm far from an expert
            on any of it, but it's interesting to see how things work. Plus, it helps when playing Kerbal Space Program
            to understand the basics of orbital mechanics...
            <br>
            On a side note, I found 2022's winner of the Nobel Prize to be quite an incredible discovery. To sum it up,
            every atom can be "entangled" with another in the universe. This means that the atoms have identical
            properties. These properties can be shared over great distances. The implications of this discovery are
            incredible and could lead to huge leaps forward in quantum techology.

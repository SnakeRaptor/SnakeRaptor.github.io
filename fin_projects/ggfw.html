        <h2>About GGFW</h2>
        <p>
            The Great Generic Focus Rework, or GGFW, is a mod I've created for Hearts of Iron IV. It aims to overhaul
            the game's generic focus tree and add new politcal paths, as well as make minor nations actually have a
            chance of becoming strong.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Progress Report</h2>
        <p>The Great Generic Focus Rework is technically complete. The game is fully playable as any nation which uses
            the tree. However, I'm currently working on testing the mod for bugs. I also need to make some tweaks to the
            balance of the mod.</p>
        <p>Another change I'm considering still making is adding a non-aligned branch to the political tree. However, I
            doubt this will be in the initial release of the mod.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>The mod isn't yet available to download, as it is still in the testing phase. However, I will add a link to
            download it from the Steam Workshop when it becomes available.</p>
